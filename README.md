  # hello-world
10/30/2023. Getting started.

print("Hello world!")

  # Figure out how to
enable.funky(autocorrect)

  #  Nice to meet you all!
  I am looking foreward to learn a lot from the Github-community.
  And hopefully contribute more as I become more knowledgeable.

Rust Notes:
- _ is skip
- Variables start as imutable, f = mut
- Shrothand syntax, example: x += 2; == (x = x + 2;
  - Better example:
// Fill the blanks in the code to make it compile
// fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x += 2; 
    
    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("Success!");
}
